# Instagrid

It was a really interesting and challenging project. It was my 3rd project at RED Academy.

Basically I had to: 
Dynamically fetch photos and populate them in a webpage via the Instagram API based a text string input into a search field;

Link each returned image to its URL on Instagram (unless undertaking lightbox stretch goal);

So I used basic HTML5 and CSS3 + jQuery with an AJAX request to 'GET' data from the Instagram API and append the results into a HTML frame.

The website is responsive for  3 breakpoints (phones, tablet and desktop) and the columns of the grid change with Flexbox (Css).
